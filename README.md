Training project #1 for a Python Developer course at hexlet.io
This project consist of 5 simple games. There is randomizer for numbers at questions.


1. "Check if number is even" game  
   Rules: random number will be shown and gamer should input answer 'yes' if it is even, and 'no' if it isn't.  
   You can start it by `brain-even`
   
    
2. "Calculator" game  
   Rules: random math expression will be shown, for example, 15 + 16, which gamer should calculate and input answer.   
   You can start it by `brain-calc`
   
   
3. "Greatest common divisor" game  
   Rules: two random numbers will be shown, for example, 20 50. Gamer should calculate and input the greatest common divisor for this two numbers, 10 in this case.  
   You can start it by `brain-gcd`
   

4. "Arithmetic progression" game  
   Rules: a sequence of numbers, which is present the arithmetic progression, will be shown. One term will be replaced with '..'. Gamer should calculate and input this term.  
   You can start it by `brain-progression`


5. "Check if number is prime" game  
   Rules:  random number will be shown and gamer should input answer 'yes' if it is prime, and 'no' if it isn't.
   You can start it by `brain-prime`


Make installation build by **poetry**:  
`poetry build`  
and install it:  
`python3 -m pip install hexlet_code-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`
